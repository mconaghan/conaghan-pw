<p> To install bike navigate for Android:</p>
<li> Install <a href = "https://www.dropbox.com/android"> the dropbox app on your phone </a> </li>
<li> Copy the files in <a href  = "http://martinconaghan.dyndns.org/AndroidApps/"> here </a> into your dropbox account </li>
<li> Open the files using the dropbox app on your phone, this will install the apps </li> 
<li> If you haven't already you'll need to allow unsigned applications, and you shouldn't do this unless you trust that I'm not putting a virus on your phone. To do this go to Settings->Applications->Unknown Sources </li>
<li> The second app will allow you to send me some log files which will help me to diagnose any problems you have. If you have a problem using the app, load the LogCollector app and email it to me (mconaghan@gmail.com) </li>
</p>
<p> When using the app you should use headphones if you can, and put the phone somewhere you can feel it vibrating. Before using it for the first time you can feel what the different vibrations are, in summary:
<li> One long vibration for turn left or first exit </li>
<li> Two long vibrations for 2nd exit. You WILL NOT get a vibration for "Continue straight", assume that you are going straight unless told otherwise </i>
<li> Three long vibrations for 3rd exit or turn right </li>
<li> Four long vibrations for 4th exit... </li>
<li> A short vibration at the end of one/three vibrations means slight/keep left or right </li>
<li> Continuous short vibrations mean that you are close (50m away from) the next turn </li>
</p>
<p>You can press the volume button (either up or down) twice in quick succession to have the journey information read out to you.<p>
<p> Sometimes the app will not close cleanly, and it will leave the GPS running on your phone. To stop it:
<li> Settings->Applications->Manage applications->BikeDirect->Force stop </li>
